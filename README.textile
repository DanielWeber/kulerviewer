h3. What's this?

This is a _very_ simple (regarding features and implementation) SWT viewer for Adobe ASE files created by "kuler":http://kuler.adobe.com/ [1]. It has not been tested with .ase files from other sources. All I wanted to achieve was to have an easy way of 'reading' downloaded .ase files with a free application.

The implementation bases on the description of the .ase file format povided by "Carl Camera":http://iamacamera.org/default.aspx?id=109 .

h3. How do I use it?

It accepts a single command line parameter, an .ase file:


pre. java -jar kulerviewer.jar myTheme.ase

When run, it will open up a dialog displaying all colors [2] described in the .ase file.

If no file is specified, an empty dialog will be shown.

Once open, you can also drag and drop .ase files to the dialog, which will then be updated to show the contents of that .ase file.

Right-clicking on one of the colors will copy the hex-code representing the same RGB color to the clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere, e.g. into a css file.

fn1. "kuler":http://kuler.adobe.com/ is a web application provided by Adobe which allows to create and share color themes.

fn2. Currently, only RGB coded colors are supported. Neither CMYK nor any of the other formats that may occur in .ase files are supported.
